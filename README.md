# synthetic_road_patten
## This repository is dedicated to processing data from the Silab simulator, with the primary objective of leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to train a complete network capable of generating realistic synthetic data. The generated data includes key driving parameters such as velocity, acceleration, and steering angle, with the flexibility to incorporate additional features as needed.By applying machine learning techniques, this project aims to enhance the quality of synthesized driving data, enabling more robust analysis and simulation in various driving conditions.
